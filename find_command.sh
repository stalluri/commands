#The xargs command takes white space characters (tabs, spaces, new lines) as delimiters. You can narrow it down only for the new line characters ('\n') with -d option like this
ls *.mp3 | xargs -d '\n' mplayer
ls *.mp3 | xargs -0 mplayer
# Second option above is the best in conjucntion with find's -print 0
#The xargs utility reads space, tab, newline and end-of-file delimited strings from the standard input and executes utility with the strings as arguments.
#You want to avoid using space as a delimiter. This can be done by changing the delimiter for xargs
